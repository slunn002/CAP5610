    "Please answer the questions below. Copy this notebook and submit your answers under each problem, inserting cells as needed. You may use a combination of [python](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.html), [markdown](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html), and [LaTex](http://data-blog.udacity.com/posts/2016/10/latex-primer/) to formulate your responses. Please add your initials to the file name prior to submission. For example, if your name is Juana Perez, you would use the following filename: problem_set_0_JP.ipynb. Prior to completing this assignment, you should brush up on [calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus-home) and [linear algebra](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra)."

You can read more about this dataset [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#diabetes-dataset). Plot the MSE vs iteration number, as well as the data and final linear surface (in 3D since there are two features). Hint: in order to plot functions in 3D, use [np.meshgrid](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.meshgrid.html).\n",
